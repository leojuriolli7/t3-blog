# T3 Blog

Deployed to Vercel on https://t3-blog-pi.vercel.app/

This is a fullstack blog application made with the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/). 

Aditionally, I used [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) Buckets for file uploads, with presigned urls for securely accessing the stored files, ensuring they are safe and private.

## Features

- Login with Google, Github or discord, or with a [Magic link](https://www.beyondidentity.com/glossary/magic-links) to your e-mail.
- Create & edit posts.
- Tag your posts.
- Upload files to your posts as attachments: You can upload videos, images, audio or documents (.pdf, .msword, etc.)
- Upload images to your posts' body by dragging and dropping (or file system) like on Github!
- Every file uploaded can be interacted - You can listen to the audios using a custom-built audio-player, watch the videos, download any of the files, etc.)
- **Like or dislike posts**.
- **Create a poll on your post** and let users vote on it.
- **Add a link to your post with link scraping** using [metascraper.](https://metascraper.js.org/) 
- Comment on posts.
- Use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to write your posts & comments.
- Reply to comments on posts (**Infinitely nested comment replies** like reddit)
- **Favorite posts** and browse through all your favorited posts.
- **Follow users and be followed by other users**, see their and your followers/following.
- See a **personalized "Following" timeline** with posts from your following.
- Search posts & tags with **full-text search**.
- Access yours or other users' profiles and see their posts.
- Personalize your profile - Upload an avatar, change your username, add a bio and a profile link.
- Search for posts using different filters and by their tags.
- Search engine optimizations through meta-tags, server-side-rendering and semantic HTML.

## The stack

- Next.js
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) for type-safe communication with the database.
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io) for a type-safe API & data-fetching.
- [Next Auth](https://next-auth.js.org/) for authorization. - Also using the [Prisma Adapter](https://next-auth.js.org/adapters/prisma) to store session info in my DB.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling & [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/) for unstyled primitives to use with Tailwind.
- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for storing file uploads: This is done with [presigned urls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html), which guarantees the files uploaded are safe and private.
- [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for validations.
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com) for forms.
- [Keen Slider](https://keen-slider.io/) for a carousel component.
- [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) & [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/) to parse the markdown on the server-side, and convert it to HTML before sending it to the client. 
- [react-markdown-editor-lite](https://github.com/HarryChen0506/react-markdown-editor-lite/) for a very quick and performant MD editor.
- [Metascraper](https://metascraper.js.org/) for scraping links.
- [auto-animate](https://auto-animate.formkit.com/) - automatic animations, [Next Themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes) - easy dark mode support, [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/) - icons, [React Toastify](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/) - toasts, [React popper](https://popper.js.org/) for a custom popover component, [React dropzone](https://react-dropzone.js.org/) for a dropzone component.

## Improving the user experience

- I used [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) (formerly React Query) to implement [optimistic updates](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/guides/optimistic-updates), allowing the UI to update without having to wait for a backend response, making for a blazing fast experience. - You can like/dislike posts and see the feedback immediately, or edit a post and see the changes applied instantaneously.
- Implemented infinite scrolling on multiple screens with TanStack Query's `useInfiniteQuery`, tRPC and the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API).
- I used [Lodash debounce](https://lodash.com/docs/#debounce) to debounce search results and improve the search input performance while keeping a good UX. (Typing and automatically receiving results) 

### Processing markdown on the server

Another important UX improvement was when I switched from converting markdown to HTML on the client-side with [React Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown) to converting MD to HTML on the server-side, and returning simple HTML to the client.

I could notice whenever I first loaded the site, or scrolled down to load new posts, the page would slow down/crash for a bit, presumably to process & convert the markdown text it was receiving. This poor UX was fixed with this change.  **This contributed to a huge boost in the performance scores of the website:**

I truncate the HTML (Limit it to 250 characters) to reduce the size of the DOM and avoid sending unnecessary HTML to the client. It is also parsed before being sent to the client, adjusting for Search Engine Optimizations.

## Overcoming T3 Stack limitations
tRPC [does not support `multipart/form-data`](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/discussions/658#discussioncomment-998746), so file uploads could not be done reliably inside the tRPC router. For that reason, I decided to use the AWS SDK, S3 buckets and presigned URLs, a very safe and reliable method of uploading files. 

In this case, the tRPC router is only responsible with creating presigned URLs for uploads on the client and getting/parsing the AWS objects before sending the JSON to the client on any queries.
